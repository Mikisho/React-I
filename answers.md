### All Answers to Partner Study should be filled out in this file.
 * 1. Single-Page-Applications are web apps that react with the user in a dynamic way by rewriting the current page without loading the entire new page form a server.

This helps reduce the latency of fetching such large static content and hence the latency to completely render webpages.
